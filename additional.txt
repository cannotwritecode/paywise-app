Please update the `GET /api/v1/users/:id/rewards` endpoint to include a `description` field for each badge in the `badges` array. This is used in the frontend UI.
Example:
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "First Price",
  "description": "Submit your first price",
  "icon": "/badges/first.png",
  "achieved": true
}
```
